2. Enter total cost for all leads (auto-calculates cost per lead)
3. System analyzes and maps columns
4. Imports all leads
5. Shows success/error counts

---

## Lead Temperature & Follow-ups

### Temperature System Purpose
- **Prioritization** - Focus on hot leads first
- **Segmentation** - Group leads by engagement level
- **Follow-up Strategy** - Different approaches for different temperatures

### Follow-up Strategy
**Warm/Hot Leads:**
- Get auto-suggested follow-up dates
- Appear in Follow-Up Reminders sidebar
- Higher priority in workflow

**Cold Leads:**
- No auto-suggestions (avoid clutter)
- Can manually set follow-ups if needed
- Lower priority

### Contact Attempt Strategy
**Multi-channel Tracking:**
- Tracks attempts across call, text, email
- Single counter increments for all contact types
- AI can later analyze: "Lead converted after 2 calls + 1 text"

**Data Collection:**
- Building dataset for AI insights
- Will identify patterns like:
  - Optimal number of attempts
  - Best time of day to call
  - Most effective channel per lead type

---

## Database Backup & Safety

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Database Safety Rules

1. **NEVER commit the database to git** - The database is excluded from version control
2. **ALWAYS create a backup before deploying** - Use `./scripts/backup-database.sh`
3. **Production and local databases are completely separate** - They never sync via git
4. **Automated backups run daily** - 2:00 AM EST, 7-day retention
5. **See DISASTER_RECOVERY.md** for full recovery procedures

### Backup System

**Automated Backups:**
- Runs daily at 2:00 AM EST via cron job
- Keeps 7 days of backups
- Location: `/var/www/the-forge/backups/`

**Manual Backup:**
```bash
cd /var/www/the-forge
./scripts/backup-database.sh
```

**Restore from Backup:**
```bash
cd /var/www/the-forge
./scripts/restore-database.sh /var/www/the-forge/backups/forge_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db
pm2 restart the-forge
```

**Check Existing Backups:**
```bash
ls -lh /var/www/the-forge/backups/
```

### Data Loss Prevention

On **October 9, 2025**, we experienced a critical data loss incident where production data was overwritten by the local development database during a git pull. This happened because the database was previously tracked in git.

**Safeguards Now in Place:**
1. Database removed from git tracking (both local and production)
2. Enhanced `.gitignore` with explicit database exclusions
3. Daily automated backups with 7-day retention
4. Manual backup script for pre-deployment backups
5. Restore script for quick recovery
6. Comprehensive disaster recovery documentation

**See DISASTER_RECOVERY.md for:**
- Complete recovery procedures
- Backup/restore testing protocols
- Prevention checklists
- Emergency contact information

## Deployment Information

### Production Server
- **Provider:** DigitalOcean
- **IP Address:** 143.244.185.41
- **Port:** 3000
- **URL:** http://143.244.185.41:3000 (always include :3000)
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Process Manager:** PM2 (configured for auto-restart on server reboot)

### Deployment Process

**Standard Deployment (from local machine):**

1. **Local Development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Run development server (uses Turbopack for speed)
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Your message"
   git push
   ```

3. **Update Production Server:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@143.244.185.41
   cd /var/www/the-forge

   # ALWAYS create a backup before deploying
   ./scripts/backup-database.sh

   # Pull latest changes
   git pull origin master

   # Build and restart
   npm install
   npm run build
   pm2 restart the-forge --update-env
   pm2 save
   ```

### Critical Production Configuration

**Build Configuration:**
- **Turbopack is DISABLED for production builds** (package.json: `"build": "next build"`)
- **Reason:** VPS has limited memory (957MB) - Turbopack causes Out-Of-Memory crashes
- **Development still uses Turbopack** for faster compilation
- **Both produce identical production builds**

**PM2 Auto-Startup:**
- PM2 is configured to auto-start on server reboot
- Process list is saved via `pm2 save`
- If server restarts, The Forge will automatically come back online

**Environment Variables:**
- Located in `/var/www/the-forge/.env.local`
- Contains `AUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- PM2 must be restarted with `--update-env` flag to pick up changes

### Important Notes
- **Database Location:** `/var/www/the-forge/data/forge.db`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Database is NOT tracked in git** - Production data stays on server, never syncs via git
- **Daily Automated Backups:** Database backed up every day at 2:00 AM EST (7-day retention)
- **See DISASTER_RECOVERY.md** for backup procedures and data recovery protocols
- **ESLint/TypeScript disabled in production** - For faster builds (set in next.config.ts)
- **Always access via :3000** - Nginx reverse proxy exists but causes NextAuth session issues
- **Do not use Turbopack flag in production builds** - Will crash due to memory limits

2. **Server Components** - Next.js App Router for better performance
3. **Real-time Updates** - State management ensures UI updates without page refresh
4. **Timezone Handling** - All timestamps stored in UTC, converted to Mountain Time for display
5. **CSV Flexibility** - Smart mapping handles various formats without manual configuration

### Common Operations

**Add a new field to leads:**
1. Update `types/lead.ts` interface
2. Update `lib/database/connection.ts` schema
3. Add column with ALTER TABLE (for existing databases)
4. Update form in `page.tsx`
5. Update API routes to handle new field

**Add a new activity type:**
1. Update `ActivityType` in `types/lead.ts`
2. Add to activity form in `page.tsx`
3. Add icon/label in `getActivityTypeIcon()` and `getActivityTypeLabel()`

**Add a new status:**
1. Update `LeadStatus` in `types/lead.ts`
2. Add to status dropdown in `page.tsx`
3. Add color coding in status badge logic

### Debugging Tips
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Check PM2 logs on server: `pm2 logs the-forge`
- Verify database with: `sqlite3 data/forge.db "SELECT * FROM leads LIMIT 5"`
- Check API responses in Network tab

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Build fails with "SIGKILL" error
**Symptoms:**
- `npm run build` crashes with "Next.js build worker exited with code: null and signal: SIGKILL"
- Build hangs at "Creating an optimized production build..."

**Cause:** Out of memory - Turbopack uses too much RAM for the VPS (957MB available)

**Solution:**
1. Edit `package.json` line 7
2. Change `"build": "next build --turbopack"` to `"build": "next build"`
3. Run `npm run build` again
4. This is already fixed in current production configuration

**Date Fixed:** October 7, 2025

---

#### Issue: Can't log in after deployment
**Symptoms:**
- Login works at `http://143.244.185.41:3000`
- Login fails at `http://143.244.185.41` (through Nginx)
- Error logs show: `[auth][error] CredentialsSignin`

**Cause:** NextAuth v5 has issues with the Nginx reverse proxy configuration despite `trustHost: true` being set

**Solution:**
- **Always use `http://143.244.185.41:3000`** (include the :3000 port)
- Bookmark this address to avoid confusion
- Nginx is configured and running but should not be used for authentication

**Decision Made:** October 7, 2025 - Use :3000 permanently instead of troubleshooting reverse proxy

---

#### Issue: Site is down after server reboot
**Symptoms:**
- Can't access `http://143.244.185.41:3000`
- Connection timeout or refused

**Cause:** PM2 not configured to auto-start, or process crashed

**Solution:**
1. SSH into server: `ssh root@143.244.185.41`
2. Check PM2 status: `pm2 status`
3. If stopped: `pm2 restart the-forge`
4. If not listed: `cd /var/www/the-forge && pm2 start npm --name "the-forge" -- start`
5. Save configuration: `pm2 save`

**Prevention:**
- PM2 auto-startup is now configured (as of October 7, 2025)
- Process list saved, will auto-resurrect after reboot

---

#### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Symptoms:**
- Auth errors
- Features not working as expected
- Different behavior in production vs. local

**Cause:** PM2 caches environment variables, doesn't reload .env.local automatically

**Solution:**
```bash
pm2 restart the-forge --update-env
```

**Always use `--update-env` flag when restarting after deployment**

---

#### Issue: Multiple lockfile warning during build
**Symptoms:**
- Warning about `/var/www/package-lock.json` and `/var/www/the-forge/package-lock.json`
- Build still works but shows warning

**Cause:** Stray `package-lock.json` in parent directory

**Solution:**
```bash
rm /var/www/package-lock.json
```

**Date Fixed:** October 7, 2025

---

#### Issue: PM2 shows high restart count (‚Ü∫ 800+)
**Symptoms:**
- `pm2 status` shows restart count in hundreds
- App seems to work but restarts frequently

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check logs: `pm2 logs the-forge --err --lines 100`
- Look for crash patterns or memory issues
- Monitor with: `pm2 monit`

**Status:** Identified October 7, 2025 - needs further investigation

---

### Emergency Recovery

**If The Forge is completely down:**

1. **Check if server is running:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@143.244.185.41
   ```

2. **Check PM2 status:**
   ```bash
   pm2 status
   ```

3. **Restart the application:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/the-forge
   pm2 restart the-forge --update-env
   ```

4. **Check logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs the-forge --lines 50
   ```

5. **If build is corrupted, rebuild:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/the-forge
   git status  # Make sure you're on master and up to date
   rm -rf .next
   npm run build
   pm2 restart the-forge --update-env
   ```

6. **Verify site is accessible:**
   - Visit: http://143.244.185.41:3000
   - Try logging in
