## Lead Temperature & Follow-ups

### Temperature System Purpose
- **Prioritization** - Focus on hot leads first
- **Segmentation** - Group leads by engagement level
- **Follow-up Strategy** - Different approaches for different temperatures

### Follow-up Strategy
**Warm/Hot Leads:**
- Get auto-suggested follow-up dates
- Appear in Follow-Up Reminders sidebar
- Higher priority in workflow

**Cold Leads:**
- No auto-suggestions (avoid clutter)
- Can manually set follow-ups if needed
- Lower priority

### Contact Attempt Strategy
**Multi-channel Tracking:**
- Tracks attempts across call, text, email
- Single counter increments for all contact types
- AI can later analyze: "Lead converted after 2 calls + 1 text"

**Data Collection:**
- Building dataset for AI insights
- Will identify patterns like:
  - Optimal number of attempts
  - Best time of day to call
  - Most effective channel per lead type

2. Update `lib/database/connection.ts` schema
3. Add column with ALTER TABLE (for existing databases)
4. Update form in `page.tsx`
5. Update API routes to handle new field

**Add a new activity type:**
