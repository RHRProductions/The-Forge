**Go to:** http://localhost:3001/test-sequence

Click the 4 buttons in order:

1. **"Create Sequence"** - Sets up the 5 emails in database
   - Should see: Green success message
   - If error "already exists" - that's fine, skip to #2

2. **"Enroll First Lead"** - Adds your first lead to the sequence
   - Should see: `{ enrolled: [123], skipped: [], failed: [] }`
   - If "no leads found" - add a test lead in your CRM first

3. **"Send Due Emails"** - Sends Email #1 immediately
   - Should see: `{ sent: 1, stopped: 0, skipped: 0 }`
   - Check the lead's email inbox - Email #1 should arrive

4. **"View Booking Page"** - Opens the appointment scheduler
   - Should see: Right Hand Retirement branded page
   - 12 time slots shown
